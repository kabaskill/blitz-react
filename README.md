# Create Minimalist App

This is the first iteration of the npm package 'create minimalist app'. The goal of the project is to create a React and/or Next.js starter project with only the necessary files and libraries.

It's not published on npm yet, so use `npm link` to test the library locally.

Currently the package provides a React project with Tailwind as well as option of TypeScript and GitHub integration. 

Stay tuned for updates.
